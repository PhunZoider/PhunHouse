# PhunHouse - The Safehouse Extender

A Project Zomboid mod for enhancing the Safehouse system

## Features

- Players can create their own safehouse, even if it isn't a house!
- Players can extend their existing safehouse using `House Paint`
- Allow players to have multiple safehouses

## Gameplay

Safehouses can be created as normal in game (though in PZ you can only do this once). Alternatively (or additionally) you can also create a safehouse from scratch by finding and using "House Paint" (found in the world where you generally find paint).

Right clicking House Paint will give you 2 options:

### Create Safehouse

This option will be available whenever you have less than the max safehouse's in your settings, you are far enough away from another safehouse and you have enough paint. All of these values are customised via settings.

### Extend Safehouse

This option will be available whenever you are close enough to a safehouse you are an owner or member of, you have enough paint and the safehouse isn't already max size. All of these values are customised via settings.
